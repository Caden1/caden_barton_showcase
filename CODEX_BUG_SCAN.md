| File | Line(s) | Issue | Severity (low/med/high) | Proposed fix (1–2 sentences) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lib/caden_barton_showcase_web/live/home_live.ex | 8-73 | LiveView renders without wrapping content in `<Layouts.app>` so the home page skips the shared navigation/flash layout and deviates from the pattern used elsewhere. | med | Wrap the template in `<Layouts.app flash={@flash}>…</Layouts.app>` so the home view uses the shared header, flash group, and consistent layout styling. |
| lib/caden_barton_showcase_web.ex | 51-56 | `live_view/0` uses `Phoenix.LiveView` without a default layout, forcing every LiveView to remember to wrap the template manually and making omissions (as in `HomeLive`) easy. | med | Configure the macro with `use Phoenix.LiveView, layout: {CadenBartonShowcaseWeb.Layouts, :app}` (or similar) so LiveViews get the app layout by default and only opt out when needed. |
| lib/caden_barton_showcase_web/live/build_show_live.ex | 6-12 | Missing slug returns a “Project not found” message but keeps HTTP 200, which misleads clients/search engines and doesn’t surface a proper 404. | low | When `get_project/1` returns nil, set a 404 status (e.g., via `put_status/2`) and optionally redirect to the builds index or render the not-found view with the correct status. |
| lib/caden_barton_showcase_web/components/layouts.ex | 135 | Theme toggle indicator uses `border-1`, which Tailwind/DaisyUI doesn’t generate, leaving the toggle thumb without the intended border/contrast. | low | Replace `border-1` with a valid width class (e.g., `border` or `border-2`) alongside the existing color class to render the border as designed. |
